# Elegant: Getting Started

Elegant ORM, an object-relational mapper that makes it enjoyable to interact with your database. When using Elegant, each database table has a corresponding "Model" that is used to interact with that table. In addition to retrieving records from the database table, Elegant models allow you to insert, update, and delete records from the table as well.
