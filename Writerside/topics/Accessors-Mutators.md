# Elegant: Accessors &amp; Mutators

<show-structure depth="2"/>

## Overview
Elegant provides powerful mechanisms to transform attribute values as they're read from or written to your database. These features enable you to:

* Automatically encrypt sensitive data during storage and decrypt it on retrieval
* Convert database strings into structured data types like arrays or objects
* Format values consistently across your application
* Implement custom business logic for attribute handling

### Understanding Accessors
Accessors modify attribute values when you retrieve them from a model instance. They act as intermediaries between the raw database value and the value your application code receives.
To create an accessor, define a protected method on your model class. The method name should use camelCase formatting to represent the underlying database column name.

Example: Creating a Name Accessor

```TypeScript
class User extends Model {
  gender:string
  firstName:string
  lastName:string
  name({accessor}) {
    accessor(name => this.gender === 'm' ? 'Mr. ' + name : 'Ms. ' + name)
  }
}
```

When you access user.name, Elegant automatically invokes this accessor, applying the appropriate title prefix based on the user's gender attribute.

### Accessing Transformed Values:
```typescript
const user = await User.find(1);
console.log(user.name); // "Mr. John Smith" or "Ms. Jane Doe"
```
The accessor executes transparently whenever you reference the attribute. Your application code works with the transformed value while the raw data remains unchanged in the database.
### Understanding Mutators
Mutators work in the opposite directionâ€”they transform attribute values before saving them to the database. This ensures data consistency and can enforce formatting rules at the model level.

Example: Creating a First Name Mutator

```typescript
class User extends Model {
  firstName({ mutator }) {
    mutator(firstName => firstName === 'Williams' ? 'Bill' : firstName)
  }
}
```
In this example, the `firstName` method receives a configuration object containing a mutator function. You call mutator with a transformation function that takes the current value and modifies it. This function executes whenever the `firstName` attribute is accessed or modified.

How It Works:

* The transformation function receives the attribute's value as its parameter
* Your logic determines what transformation to apply
* The mutated value becomes what your application sees
* In this case, any user with the first name "Williams" will display as "Bill"

This pattern provides a clean, functional approach to attribute transformation that integrates seamlessly with Elegant's TypeScript-based architecture.

### Combining Accessors and Mutators
You can define both transformations for the same attribute, creating a complete bidirectional transformation pipeline:
```typescript
class User extends Model {
  firstName({ accessor, mutator }) {
    accessor(firstName => firstName.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + firstName.slice(1));
    mutator(firstName => firstName.toLowerCase());
  }
}
```
This approach keeps related transformation logic organized in one place. The mutator stores values in lowercase, while the accessor capitalizes them on retrieval, ensuring consistent data storage and presentation formatting.
